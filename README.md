1Ô∏è‚É£ SELECT with WHERE

Goal:Get data based on specific conditions

Example: Show the population of Germany  

SELECT population FROM world
WHERE name = 'Germany';

2Ô∏è‚É£ SELECT with IN

Goal: Get values from a list of possible values

Example: Show the name and population for Sweden, Norway, and Denmark

SELECT name, population FROM world
WHERE name IN ('Sweden', 'Norway', 'Denmark');

3Ô∏è‚É£ SELECT with BETWEEN

Goal: Get data in a specific numeric range

Example: Show countries with an area between 200,000 and 250,000 sq km

SELECT name, area FROM world
